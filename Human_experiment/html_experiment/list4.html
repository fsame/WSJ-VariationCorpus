                  <p class="lead">If you have done a variant of this task today,
                     please do not continue. We can only use one response set per
                     responder.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> In the next pages, you will be presented with 10
                     texts, consisting of news texts, from an American newspaper.
                     Each text will talk about one specific subject, which can be,
                     for example, a person, a company, a group, a country or a
                     commercial product. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> In each text, all references to one subject are
                     replaced by empty boxes. Your goal is to fill those gaps,
                     referring to the main subject of the text, so that the text
                     becomes easy to understand. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> Always talk about the whole subject: so if the
                     topic is *Mr and Mrs Smith* and you know they are a couple from
                     London, then you can fill a box with "Mr and Mrs Smith", "the
                     London couple", "this couple", "they", "Mr and Mrs Smith's",
                     "the couple's" and so on. But a box is never about "Mr Smith" or
                     "Mrs Smith" on their own.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> Although we show you words like "he", "she", "it",
                     "they" or similar, you do not have to use them. In the box you
                     can put any way of identifying the subject. If the subject is
                     "Joe Biden, the president of the United States" you can put "Joe
                     Biden" or "Mr Biden" or "Joe Biden's" or "the president of the
                     United States" or "the president" or "the president's" or "him"
                     or "his", or any other way of identifying this person. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> At the start of each text, you will see a line
                     which gives you the subject of the text, and the thing or person
                     you need to refer to as you fill out the boxes. To help you
                     understand how to talk about the thing or person you will also
                     have a helper sentence providing more information. For
                     example:

                  of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack
                  of international attention . The deportation of more than 315,000 men , women
                  and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations
                  seen in the postwar years . Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry :
                  that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical
                  sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century . Today's Turks in Bulgaria ,
                  in other words , deserve what is coming to them four centuries later
