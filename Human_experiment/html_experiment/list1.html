                  <p class="lead">If you have done a variant of this task today,
                     please do not continue. We can only use one response set per
                     responder.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> In the next pages, you will be presented with 10
                     texts, consisting of news texts, from an American newspaper.
                     Each text will talk about one specific subject, which can be,
                     for example, a person, a company, a group, a country or a
                     commercial product. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> In each text, all references to one subject are
                     replaced by empty boxes. Your goal is to fill those gaps,
                     referring to the main subject of the text, so that the text
                     becomes easy to understand. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> Always talk about the whole subject: so if the
                     topic is *Mr and Mrs Smith* and you know they are a couple from
                     London, then you can fill a box with "Mr and Mrs Smith", "the
                     London couple", "this couple", "they", "Mr and Mrs Smith's",
                     "the couple's" and so on. But a box is never about "Mr Smith" or
                     "Mrs Smith" on their own.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> Although we show you words like "he", "she", "it",
                     "they" or similar, you do not have to use them. In the box you
                     can put any way of identifying the subject. If the subject is
                     "Joe Biden, the president of the United States" you can put "Joe
                     Biden" or "Mr Biden" or "Joe Biden's" or "the president of the
                     United States" or "the president" or "the president's" or "him"
                     or "his", or any other way of identifying this person. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> At the start of each text, you will see a line
                     which gives you the subject of the text, and the thing or person
                     you need to refer to as you fill out the boxes. To help you
                     understand how to talk about the thing or person you will also
                     have a helper sentence providing more information. For
                     example:

                  Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 %
                  lower than a previous estimate . Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69
                  million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level
                  .

                  dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many
                  producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice
                  president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent ,
                  Interhome Energy Inc . Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is
                  down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion
                  unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s .

                  than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , " said Robert Feick

               <p class="lead"> Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production
                  decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in
                  western Canada . Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in
                  western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of
                  light crude .

                  current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1

                  York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . That ranks <input type="text" required maxlength="45" autocomplete="off" name="citycountry_10328_wsj2363_7" id="citycountry_10328_wsj2363_7"> as the

                  the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on
                  oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East . " It 's very much a growing
                  concern . But when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , " he
                  said .
               </p>
               
               <p class="lead"> Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial
                  's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore
                  crude , however , since Canadian imports are limited in any case by <input type="text" required maxlength="45" autocomplete="off" name="citycountry_10328_wsj2363_9" id="citycountry_10328_wsj2363_9">

               <p class="lead"> Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion , which
                  would have required regulatory approval , Interprovincial intended to add
                  200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a
                  modest expansion by 1991 .

               <p class="lead"> Detrex said it is one of at least 17 companies notified
                  by the Environmental Protection Agency that they may be potentially responsible
                  for cleaning up the Fields Brook watershed near Detrex 's Ashtabula plant at a
                  total cost the EPA estimates at $48 million -- a figure Detrex said the
                  companies dispute.
