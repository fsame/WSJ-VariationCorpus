                  <p class="lead">If you have done a variant of this task today,
                     please do not continue. We can only use one response set per
                     responder.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> In the next pages, you will be presented with 10
                     texts, consisting of news texts, from an American newspaper.
                     Each text will talk about one specific subject, which can be,
                     for example, a person, a company, a group, a country or a
                     commercial product. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> In each text, all references to one subject are
                     replaced by empty boxes. Your goal is to fill those gaps,
                     referring to the main subject of the text, so that the text
                     becomes easy to understand. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> Always talk about the whole subject: so if the
                     topic is *Mr and Mrs Smith* and you know they are a couple from
                     London, then you can fill a box with "Mr and Mrs Smith", "the
                     London couple", "this couple", "they", "Mr and Mrs Smith's",
                     "the couple's" and so on. But a box is never about "Mr Smith" or
                     "Mrs Smith" on their own.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> Although we show you words like "he", "she", "it",
                     "they" or similar, you do not have to use them. In the box you
                     can put any way of identifying the subject. If the subject is
                     "Joe Biden, the president of the United States" you can put "Joe
                     Biden" or "Mr Biden" or "Joe Biden's" or "the president of the
                     United States" or "the president" or "the president's" or "him"
                     or "his", or any other way of identifying this person. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="lead"> At the start of each text, you will see a line
                     which gives you the subject of the text, and the thing or person
                     you need to refer to as you fill out the boxes. To help you
                     understand how to talk about the thing or person you will also
                     have a helper sentence providing more information. For
                     example:

                  it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may

                  flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry . " Olivetti

                  takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian . The GAF
                  trials were viewed as previews of the government's strength in its cases
                  against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian . Mr. Jefferies's performance as a witness
                  was expected to affect his sentencing .
               </p>
               
               <p class="lead"> But GAF's bellwether role was short-lived . The first
                  GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary
                  Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld
                  a document . After 93 hours of deliberation , the jurors in the second trial
                  said they were hopelessly deadlocked , and another mistrial was declared on
                  March 22 .
               </p>
               
               <p class="lead"> Meanwhile , a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on
                  securities fraud and other charges in June . A month later , Mr. Jefferies was
                  spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government
                  . In August , Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts .
               </p>
               
               <p class="lead"> Nevertheless , the stakes are still high for the players
                  directly involved in the GAF case . The mistrials have left the reputations of
                  GAF , <input type="text" required maxlength="45" autocomplete="off" name="human_5192_wsj1331_4" id="human_5192_wsj1331_4"> and GAF Chairman
                  Samuel Heyman in limbo . For <input type="text" required maxlength="45" autocomplete="off" name="human_5192_wsj1331_5" id="human_5192_wsj1331_5"> , a conviction could carry penalties of five
                  years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count . GAF faces potential fines
                  of $ 500,000 for each count .
               </p>
               
               <p class="lead"> Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout
                  September , defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to
                  prevent a trial , but by the end of the month the talks had ended .
               </p>
               
               <p class="lead"> There is much speculation among attorneys not involved
                  that the strategy of GAF's attorney , Arthur Liman , and <input type="text" required maxlength="45" autocomplete="off" name="human_5192_wsj1331_6" id="human_5192_wsj1331_6"> counsel , Stephen

                  also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some
                  countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with
                  existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years .

                  eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000 , said <input type="text" required maxlength="45" autocomplete="off" name="other_2926_wsj1135_7" id="other_2926_wsj1135_7"> wouldn't " put

               <p class="lead"> The U.S. is submitting <input type="text" required maxlength="45" autocomplete="off" name="other_2926_wsj1135_8" id="other_2926_wsj1135_8"> today in Geneva ,
                  hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs
                  and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating
                  round concludes in December 1990 . Another U.S. proposal filed Monday urges more
                  " fair play " in services trade , including predictable and clear rules and
                  equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies
                  .
               </p>
               
               <p class="lead"> Unlike the earlier U.S. farm-trade proposal which
                  struck European countries as too extreme , the latest plan would provide some
                  room for maneuver . For instance , the new U.S. package makes clear there would
                  be a transition period during which GATT members could use a combination of
                  tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition . It also
                  says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they
                  experience an unusually heavy volume of imports .
               </p>
               
               <p class="lead"> Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm
                  subsidies , as the earlier U.S. proposal did , the new package calls for the
                  elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones . Less objectionable ones
                  would be subject only to some restraints , and others with a " relatively minor
                  trade impact " would be allowed to continue under certain conditions
                  .
               </p>
               
               <p class="lead"> The new U.S. plan also would establish procedures to
                  prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade
                  arbitrarily . The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the
                  European Community's current attempt to bar imports of beef from
                  hormone-treated U.S. cattle .
