text: AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County , Miss. , REF_1570_1 was one of the best known and most enterprising . REF_1570_2 sold quarter-inch fingerlings to stock other farmers ' ponds , and REF_1570_3 bought back one-pound-or-so food-fish that REF_1570_4 " live-hauled " to market along with REF_1570_5 own whiskery crop . And REF_1570_6 nearly always bought and sold for cash . Along the way , REF_1570_7 omitted a total of $ 1.5 million from REF_1570_8 receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years . The returns landed in the hands of an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator , Samuel James Baker . Mr. Baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers , live-haulers and processors throughout the South before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales , in pounds and dollars , by REF_1570_9 and others . Unknown to REF_1570_10 , he had fouled his net on a special IRS project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes . Confronted with the evidence , Mr. Tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined $ 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison .
