text: Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having REF_1587_1 , and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to REF_1587_2 , company and city officials said . The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities . GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE 's private food vending contractor , ARA Services Inc. , was suffering from a strain of REF_1587_3 , officials said . More than 700 people work in the GTE building . The cafeteria remains closed . Dr. Andrew McBride , city health director , said his staff suspects tREF_1587_4 was spread by the cafeteria worker with REF_1587_5 . The exact strain of REF_1587_6 that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week , Dr. McBride said . Hepatitis A , considered the least dangerous strain of REF_1587_7 , has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee , company and city officials said . " From a public health point of view we 're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life - threatening , " said Dr. Frank Provato , GTE 's medical director . " It 's a double-edged sword though , because it is also the most contagious kind of REF_1587_8 . " GTE officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company , said GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch .
