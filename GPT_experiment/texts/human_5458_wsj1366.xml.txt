text: It was the kind of snubbing rarely seen within the Congress , let alone within the same party . REF_1366_1 trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered REF_1366_2 testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez . It was offered as an expression of cooperation to Mr. Gonzalez , who is investigating the $ 2.5 billion failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association . But instead of thanks , REF_1366_3 was treated with cool formality . " Every witness receives a formal subpoena , " Rep. Gonzalez told REF_1366_4 . Seldom have House hearings caused so much apprehension in the Senate , where REF_1366_5 and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of Lincoln by their friend and political benefactor , Charles Keating Jr. , principal stockholder of Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. of Phoenix , Ariz . At the first day of the House Banking Committee 's hearings last week , William Seidman , chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts , said the agency is investigating whether Lincoln made illegal political contributions . Mr. Keating arranged nearly $ 1 million in donations to REF_1366_6 and REF_1366_7 various political causes , and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers . Future witnesses include a former federal S&L regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to " subvert " the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. Keating . Unlike many lawmakers , Chairman Gonzalez says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper . " When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions , then that 's a no-no in my book , " the Texas lawmaker says . And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously . " Unless the questions are answered , I will keep on going . " Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues , even those of opposing political parties . In the recent Housing and Urban Development Department scandal , for example , Rep. Thomas Lantos , the California Democrat who led the hearings , tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about HUD grants secured by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato , a New York Republican . But Chairman Gonzalez is a genuine maverick . He comes from the same political line as Wright Patman , a bank-baiting Texas populist who chaired the Banking Committee until 1974 . Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open . Early in his political career , as a city councilman in San Antonio , he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced , denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a " bat - roost meeting . " The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez 's inquiry is Danny Wall , chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision . As the principal regulator of the thrift industry , Mr. Wall delayed seizing Lincoln S&L for more than two years after his staff told him that the California thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly . Rep. Gonzalez seems primed to lash out at Mr. Wall when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from San Francisco , William Black and Mike Patriarca . Mr. Wall relieved them of responsibility for supervising Lincoln in 1988 . Mr. Gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to Washington by Mr. Wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance . " I think he is trying to improperly influence a witness , and by God I 'm not going to tolerate it , " he says . Mr. Wall , however , is a self-proclaimed " child of the Senate " and former staff director of its Banking Committee . An inquiry into his handling of Lincoln S&L inevitably will drag in REF_1366_8 and the four others , Sens. Dennis DeConcini ( D. , Ariz. ) , John McCain ( R. , Ariz. ) , John Glenn ( D. , Ohio ) and Donald Riegle ( D. , Mich . ) . They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of Lincoln S&L had dragged on for two years .
