text: GAF , Part III is scheduled to begin today . After two mistrials , the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and REF_1331_1 have changed considerably . The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government 's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider - trading investigations . In an eight-count indictment , the government charged GAF , a Wayne , N.J. , chemical maker , and REF_1331_2 with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986 . The government 's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness , Boyd L. Jefferies , the former Los Angeles brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky , and then pointed the finger at REF_1331_3 , takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian . The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government 's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian . Mr. Jefferies 's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing . But GAF 's bellwether role was short-lived . The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document . After 93 hours of deliberation , the jurors in the second trial said they were hopelessly deadlocked , and another mistrial was declared on March 22 . Meanwhile , a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June . A month later , Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government . In August , Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts . Nevertheless , the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the GAF case . The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF , REF_1331_4 and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo . For REF_1331_5 , a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count . GAF faces potential fines of $ 500,000 for each count . Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout September , defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial , but by the end of the month the talks had ended . There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of GAF 's attorney , Arthur Liman , and REF_1331_6 counsel , Stephen Kaufman , will include testimony by REF_1331_7 or Mr. Heyman . Neither testified at the previous trials .
