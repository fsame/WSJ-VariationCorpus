text: The House approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $ 2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the REF_1147_1 earthquake . The 321 - 99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance , but the cost to the Treasury is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law . By a lopsided 401-18 margin , the chamber rejected an effort to waive Gramm-Rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters , and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $ 1.44 billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by Congress . The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991, and the issue forced a confrontation between the Appropriations Committee leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta , whose REF_1147_2 district was at the center of the earthquake last week . Going to the well of the chamber , Mr. Panetta demanded the costs be fully counted . His prominent role put him in the awkward position of challenging the very committee members on whom REF_1147_3 will be most dependent in the months ahead . " We do not come to this House asking for any handout , " said the REF_1147_4 Democrat . " We do not intend to hide these costs from the American people . " The $ 2.85 billion package incorporates $ 500 million for low - interest disaster loans , $ 1 billion in highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters . The funds are in addition to $ 1.1 billion appropriated last month to assist in the recovery from Hugo , bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly $ 4 billion in unanticipated spending . Because of the vagaries of Gramm - Rudman , the immediate impact is relatively small . But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991 . Within the appropriations process , the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying the . The underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight , and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and , critics say , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance . The hastily drafted measure could hurt REF_1147_5 by requiring REF_1147_6 to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required . And REF_1147_7 delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ 185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year . Also , the high price of San Francisco real estate puts REF_1147_8 at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average . For example , disaster loans , which will go to small businesses and homeowners , offer credit as low as 4 % in some cases .
