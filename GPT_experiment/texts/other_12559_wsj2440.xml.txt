subject: The Talking Chip (it/its)
helper sentence: The Talking Chip - was a speech synthesiser laminated into an advertisement for Texas Instruments that appeared in the magazine Business Week.
text: Business Week subscribers may hear this week 's issue talking back to them . A four - page ad from Texas Instruments Inc. , running in approximately 140,000 issues of the Oct. 20 " Corporate Elite " issue of the McGraw - Hill Inc. publication , contains REF_2440_1 . Readers who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but distinctly human - sounding -- voice announce , " I am REF_2440_2 , " as REF_2440_3 launches into a 15 - second discourse on REF_2440_4 own attributes . REF_2440_5 is n't cheap -- the per - ad cost to Texas Instruments is about $ 4 , and that 's without adding in Business Week 's charge -- but Texas Instruments believes REF_2440_6 is a first . Previous efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple tone-generating chips that play a tune , but REF_2440_7 is much more sophisticated , with none of the robotic flatness that one hears , for example , when calling telephone directory services. And for those who miss the message the first time around , not to worry : Three tiny batteries provide enough juice for as many as 650 replays .
