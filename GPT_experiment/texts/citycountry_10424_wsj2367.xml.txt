text: REF_2367_1 's got trouble . Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for pool . More than 30 years ago , Prof. Harold Hill , the con man in Meredith Willson 's " The Music Man , " warned the citizens of River City , Iowa , against the game . Now kindred spirits on REF_2367_2 town council have barred the town 's fanciest hotel , the Grand Kempinski , from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge . Mayor Lynn Spruill and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along REF_2367_3 main street . And the mayor , in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to Prof. Hill 's , warned that " alcohol leads to betting , which leads to fights . " The council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years . " Obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on , " says Tom Manske , vice president of the National Pocket Billiards Association . Pool is hot in New York and Chicago , he insists , where " upscale , suit - and - tie places " are adding tables . With today 's tougher drunk driving laws , he adds , " people do n't want to just sit around and drink . " Besides , rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the Grand Kempinski , where rooms average $ 200 a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ 3.50 a pop . At the lounge , manager Elizabeth Dyer wo n't admit patrons in jeans , T-shirts or tennis shoes . But a majority of the Addison council did n't buy those arguments . Introducing pool , argued Councilwoman Riley Reinker , would be dangerous . " It would open a can of worms . " REF_2367_4 is no stranger to cans of worms , either . After REF_2367_5 previous mayor committed suicide last year , an investigation disclosed that REF_2367_6 officials regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into REF_2367_7 coffers for trips and retreats . The revelations embarrassed town officials , although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested .
