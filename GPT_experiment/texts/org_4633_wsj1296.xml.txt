text: At least 10 states are resisting REF_1296_1 nationwide effort to settle REF_1296_2 legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke REF_1296_3 license to sell securities within their borders . The reluctance of some states to let REF_1296_4 off the hook could hamper REF_1296_5 attempts to polish REF_1296_6 image after REF_1296_7 guilty plea to six felonies last month , say several people familiar with the discussions . Up to now , REF_1296_8 has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico . Just yesterday , New Hampshire announced it made a $ 75,000 settlement with REF_1296_9 , a record-tying fine for a securities - law matter in that state . These states have been entering into settlements with REF_1296_10 as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon . But individuals familiar with the generally successful Drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri .
