text: Several of the New York Stock Exchange 's own listed companies , led by giant Contel Corp. , are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange 's role in it . Claiming program trading has turned the Big Board into a " gambling casino , " REF_0591_1 said that REF_0591_2 and at least 20 other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance . The group , REF_0591_3 said in an interview , wants to end the market 's wild price swings that critics blame on computer-aided program-trading strategies . The group will complain to Washington , to the heads of program - trading firms and to the heads of the Big Board itself , REF_0591_4 said . " They should call { the exchange } Trump East , " charged REF_0591_5 . " What is the mission of the financial community -- to help some scavengers or schemers , or help corporate America ? " Contel is a $ 6 billion telephone and electronics company . Pressure has been building on the Big Board in the past two weeks to do something about market volatility , which many investors say is caused by program trading . The market 's Friday - the - 13th plunge of 190 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and the Big Board 's understated response to it , galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies listed on the exchange . Last month , program trading accounted for a record 13.8 % of average daily Big Board volume . REF_0591_6 , for example , said REF_0591_7 wrote to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. about program trading after the 190 - point Dow plunge , and as in previous queries , " what I get back is gobbledygook . " REF_0591_8 said he 's upset that Mr. Phelan , trying to calm investors after the plunge , said that investors would simply have to get used to the market 's big price swings . The Big Board " is partly to blame { for the price swings } , because they 're cowards , " said Mr. Wohlstetter .
