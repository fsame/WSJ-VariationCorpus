text: REF_1246_1 said they discovered an antibody that , in laboratory test - tube experiments , kills AIDS - infected cells while preserving healthy cells . If further experiments are successful , the work would represent a major advance in research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome . The drug AZT , the only treatment currently on the market , claims only to help stop the spread of AIDS , not to cure it . But several analysts and Japanese scientists familiar with the study , which was announced at a conference in Nagoya yesterday , expressed skepticism over the significance of the results . And REF_1246_3 acknowledged REF_1246_4 still must do much more work before REF_1246_5 can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans . Shin Yonehara , a research scientist at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science , said the antibody he discovered works by recognizing an antigen called a Fas - antigen , which is characteristic of an infected cell . The antibody then kills the cell . REF_1246_6 said REF_1246_7 experiments showed that the antibody wiped out an average of 60 % of AIDS - infected cells within three days . In some of the experiments , it killed almost all the infected cells , REF_1246_8 said . Meanwhile , fewer than 10 % of the healthy cells were killed .
