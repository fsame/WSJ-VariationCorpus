text: Just five months after Ogilvy Group was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover , REF_1317_1 said REF_1317_2 is leaving to take a top post at American Express Co . REF_1317_3 abruptly announced REF_1317_4 will leave the venerable ad agency , whose largest client is American Express , to become American Express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications . REF_1317_5 will succeed Harry L. Freeman , 57 , who has said he will retire in December . Mr. Freeman said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take " executive responsibility " for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker Edmond Safra . American Express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. Safra . The company later apologized and agreed to make $ 8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him . Although Mr. Freeman is retiring , he will continue to work as a consultant for American Express on a project basis . Ad industry executives were n't surprised by REF_1317_6 decision to leave Ogilvy. The agency , under REF_1317_7 direction , bitterly fought a takeover attempt by WPP Group PLC of London before succumbing in May . And although REF_1317_8 and WPP 's chief executive , Martin Sorrell , have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other , people close to REF_1317_9 say REF_1317_10 was unhappy giving up control of the company . Some executives also cite tension because of efforts by Mr. Sorrell , a financial man , to cut costs at the agency .
