text: Roger Rosenblatt , editor of REF_2436_1 , resigned Friday from REF_2436_2 . Mr. Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and REF_2436_3 editorial offices in Washington . " Frankly , I missed my family , " said Mr. Rosenblatt . In Mr. Rosenblatt 's tenure , REF_2436_4 advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly . But at 2.3 million weekly paid circulation , REF_2436_5 still ranks third behind Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , with 4.4 million circulation , and Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek , with 3.3 million circulation . Mortimer B. Zuckerman , chairman and editor in chief , said Mr. Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby , REF_2436_6 executive editor , and Merrill McLoughlin , a senior writer . Mr. Ruby and Ms. McLoughlin are married to each other . Mr. Zuckerman said REF_2436_7 would maintain REF_2436_8 editorial format , which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service-oriented , how-to articles . Mr. Rosenblatt , a senior writer at Time magazine before joining REF_2436_9 , said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor . The offers were to work as a writer , not an editor .
