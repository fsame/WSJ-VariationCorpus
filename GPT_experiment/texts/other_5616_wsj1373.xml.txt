subject: Computer chips (they/them/their)
helper sentence: This article is about a new computer chip with ceramic circuits whose data survives even without power.
text: REF_1373_1 Memory Is Here Today , Here Tomorrow TWO COMPANIES plan to market REF_1373_2 . Today 's most widely used data - storing chips have " volatile " memories -- their data disappear if they are n't fed a steady diet of electricity , so they need external power supplies . National Semiconductor Corp. and a start - up named Ramtron Corp. plan to start shipping so - called ferroelectric memories , which can remember data for at least 10 years without any current flowing to REF_1373_3 . REF_1373_4 use materials , such as lead zirconate titanate , to form microscopic switches that retain REF_1373_5 data without electricity . Developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology is n't fully refined . But Ramtron of Colorado Springs , Colo. , plans to start shipping commercial quantities of REF_1373_6 in December . The company expects REF_1373_7 eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment , including floppy - disk and hard - disk drives . National Semiconductor is getting ferroelectric technology from Krysalis Corp. in Albuquerque , N.M . National says it agreed to acquire Krysalis 's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips , including a 4 - kilobit memory , next year . Once production hurdles are overcome , REF_1373_8 could take over a significant part of the market . In addition to not needing an outside power source , REF_1373_9 are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips . Military buyers have shown interest , National says , because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation .
