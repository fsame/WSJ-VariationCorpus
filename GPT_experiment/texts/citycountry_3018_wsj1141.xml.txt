text: From the Sept. 30 - Oct . 4 issue of The Economist : What defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the Syrian army . The weight of Lebanon's history was also against him ; and it is a history REF_1141_1 is in danger of repeating . Like Lebanon , and however unfairly , REF_1141_2 is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration . REF_1141_3 best hope of acceptance by REF_1141_4 neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians . Like Lebanon , REF_1141_5 is being remade by demography . In Greater Israel more than half the children under six are Muslims . Within 25 years Jews will probably be the minority . Yet REF_1141_6 will neither share power with all these Arabs nor , says REF_1141_7 present prime minister , redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland . By not choosing one of these options , Israelis will condemn themselves , as the Maronites did , to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst , and so to the internal erosion of their state .
