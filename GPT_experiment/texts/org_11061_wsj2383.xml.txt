text: REF_2383_1 plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands . The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit REF_2383_2 plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management-controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders . Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged , though unsuccessfully , REF_2383_3 Dutch lawyers noted . Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense , REF_2383_4 will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV . REF_2383_5 says the Dutch-based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of REF_2383_6 and other shareholders . Speaking through REF_2383_7 Dutch lawyers , REF_2383_8 also disclosed REF_2383_9 holds a 15 % stake in Ahold . It was previously thought REF_2383_10 held a 13.6 % stake that was accumulated since July . A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred - share issue .
