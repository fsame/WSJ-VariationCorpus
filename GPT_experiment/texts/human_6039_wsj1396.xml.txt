text: The Senate convicted REF_1396_1 of eight impeachment articles , removing REF_1396_2 from REF_1396_3 $ 89,500 - a - year , lifetime job . REF_1396_4 case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him . In 1983 , REF_1396_5 was found not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before REF_1396_6 , the central charge on which the Senate convicted REF_1396_7 . REF_1396_8 was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial . With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69 - 26 to convict REF_1396_9 of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed . Conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove Judge Hastings from office .
