text: Exxon Corp. filed suit against REF_1347_1 , charging state officials interfered with the oil company 's initial efforts to treat last spring 's giant oil spill . The action is a counterclaim to a suit filed by REF_1347_2 in August against Exxon and six other oil companies . REF_1347_3 suit alleges that Exxon 's response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound . That suit and Exxon 's countersuit were filed in a state court in Anchorage . Neither suit lists specific dollar claims , largely because damage assessment has n't yet been completed . Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $ 1 billion . Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years . Exxon said in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from REF_1347_4 for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims it says resulted from REF_1347_5 conduct . The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef . Craig Tillery , an REF_1347_6 assistant attorney general , said in an interview last night that Exxon 's accusations " are not new . Exxon has made them before , at which point REF_1347_7 demonstrated they were untrue . REF_1347_8 will vigorously defend against any counterclaim . " Since the spill last March , Exxon and REF_1347_9 have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage . Exxon claims that use of dispersants , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets , was a crucial part of its immediate - response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill .
