text: The Canadian government , with a view to becoming more politically active in Latin America , is expected to announce tomorrow its application to join the Organization of American States , a Washington - based regional agency . The expected Canadian move has been welcomed by the Bush administration even though Canada has opposed such U.S. actions as the trade embargo against Cuba , the invasion of Grenada and the military support for Nicaragua 's Contra guerrillas . Latin American countries have long urged Canada to join the OAS in the hopes that it would be a counterweight to REF_0910_1 . Even though REF_0910_2 also has supported Canadian membership , it has n't been a REF_0910_3 priority . " The fact that we might not side with the Americans may be a reason why Canada 's membership in the OAS has n't been , over the years , an item high on the U.S. agenda , " said Allan Gotlieb , former Canadian ambassador to REF_0910_4 . The Canadian application is expected to be announced in San Jose , Costa Rica , by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , who is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy . " Canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere , " Mr. Mulroney said recently . Some Canadian political commentators have opposed Canada 's joining what they see as a U.S. - dominated organization . " Canada could do plenty of things to get serious about Latin America without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire " between REF_0910_5 and Latin American members of the OAS , said Jeffrey Simpson , a columnist in Toronto 's Globe & Mail newspaper . Canada , at times , could be an awkward OAS partner for REF_0910_6 if its United Nations voting record is an indication . In U.N. General Assembly votes last year , Canada voted the same as REF_0910_7 only 63 % of the time . France voted the same as REF_0910_8 76 % of the time , West Germany 79 % and Britain 83 % . Larry Birns , director of the Washington - based Council on Hemispheric Affairs , a liberal research group , said that Latin American countries would be " profoundly disappointed " if Canada were to follow the U.S. lead in the OAS .
