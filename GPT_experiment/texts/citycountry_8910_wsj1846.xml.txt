text: One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention . The deportation of more than 315,000 men , women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years . Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry : that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century . Today 's Turks in Bulgaria , in other words , deserve what is coming to them four centuries later . As if this were n't enough , the Senate Judiciary Committee is getting into the act . On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole 's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24 , 1990 , as the " National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915 - 1923 , " suffered at the hands of the warring Ottoman Empire . There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering , but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve . It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with REF_1846_1 . The resolution also comes at a time when REF_1846_2 has been seeking help from the United States in resolving REF_1846_3 Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community . REF_1846_4 has been fighting REF_1846_5 past for years , and thus far has been only partially successful . Must REF_1846_6 now accept that one of REF_1846_7 strongest allies blames REF_1846_8 for the genocide of another people ? Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward REF_1846_9 that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis . Mr. Dole 's odd effort notwithstanding , most of Turkey 's political problems lie with the Europeans .
