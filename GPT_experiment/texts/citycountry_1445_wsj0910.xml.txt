text: REF_0910_1 , with a view to becoming more politically active in Latin America , is expected to announce tomorrow REF_0910_2 application to join the Organization of American States , a Washington-based regional agency . The expected Canadian move has been welcomed by the Bush administration even though REF_0910_3 has opposed such U.S. actions as the trade embargo against Cuba , the invasion of Grenada and the military support for Nicaragua's Contra guerrillas . Latin American countries have long urged REF_0910_4 to join the OAS in the hopes that REF_0910_5 would be a counterweight to the U.S. , which for many years tended to dominate the 32-nation organization . Even though the U.S. also has supported Canadian membership , it has n't been a Washington priority . " The fact that we might not side with the Americans may be a reason why REF_0910_6 membership in the OAS has n't been , over the years , an item high on the U.S. agenda , " said Allan Gotlieb , former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. . The Canadian application is expected to be announced in San Jose , Costa Rica , by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , who is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy . " REF_0910_7 has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere , " Mr. Mulroney said recently . Some Canadian political commentators have opposed REF_0910_8 joining what they see as a U.S.-dominated organization . " Canada could do plenty of things to get serious about Latin America without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire " between the U.S. and Latin American members of the OAS , said Jeffrey Simpson , a columnist in Toronto 's Globe & Mail newspaper .
