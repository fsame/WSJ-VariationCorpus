text: Hewlett-Packard Co. will announce today REF_1555_1 . Called Task Broker , REF_1555_2 acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together . If a machine has a big computing task , REF_1555_3 asks other computers in the network for " bids " on the job . REF_1555_4 then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine . Hewlett-Packard claims that REF_1555_5 allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast . REF_1555_6 , said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. , a computer - market research company , " is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing . " In today 's computer networks , some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed . With REF_1555_7 , he said , " You get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers . " The program , which will be shipped in January 1990 , runs on the Unix operating system .
