text: In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , REF_1590_1 promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy . In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community , REF_1590_2 summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , REF_1590_3 pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' REF_1590_4 also made it clear that REF_1590_5 would be watching exchange rates carefully . A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , REF_1590_6 argued . In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency , REF_1590_7 stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary conditions . '' In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , REF_1590_8 dismissed other approaches to managing the economy . REF_1590_9 said REF_1590_10 monitors the money - supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested . Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system .
