text: REF 2394_1 , following rival
Hertz Corp. 's lead , said REF 2394_2 is
backing out of frequent-flier programs with three airlines . REF 2394_3 said REF 2394_4 wo n't renew contracts
with NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines unit , Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World
Airways unit and Midway Airlines at the end of this year . But REF 2394_5 remains involved in
programs with AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit and Delta Air Lines
. Industry estimates put REF 2394_6 annual cost of all
five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million . A spokesman for REF 2394_7 would n't specify the
costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for " far less than half
" of the total . Budget Rent a Car Corp. , of Chicago , and National Car
Rental Systems Inc. , of Minneapolis , both said they had no plans to follow
suit . In fact , Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in
these programs , in which renters earn frequent-flier miles and fliers can get
car-rental discounts . " I can not see how this news by Hertz and REF 2394_8 can not benefit Budget
's programs , " said Bob Wilson , Budget 's vice president , marketing planning
. Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has
agreements . National also participates in the Northwest
frequent-flier program along with four other airlines , including Delta and
USAir Group Inc. 's USAir unit . A month ago , Hertz , of Park Ridge , N.J. , said that it
would drop its marketing agreements at year end with Delta , America West and
Texas Air Corp. 's Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines , and that pacts
with American Airlines , UAL Inc 's United Airlines and USAir also would be
ended ... sometime after Dec. 31 . At the time , Hertz said its annual fees to
those airlines amounted to $ 20 million and that the value of redeemed awards
topped $ 15 million . Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers
were that high . Budget said its frequent-flier costs are " substantially below
" REF 2394_9 level . Robert D. Cardillo , Avis vice president of marketing ,
said , " The proliferation and costs attached to ( frequent - flier programs )
have significantly diminished their value . "
