text: Guillermo Ortiz 's Sept. 15 Americas column , " REF 1529_1 's Been
Bitten by the Privatization Bug , " is a refreshingly clear statement of REF 1529_2
commitment to privatization , and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who
wish REF 1529_3 well .
The Mexico - United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as
REF 1529_4
undersecretary of finance view REF 1529_5 reforms " in the context of a larger ,
world - wide process " of profound change toward free-market economics ,
especially in the statist countries . Having said that , we must caution against an apparent
tendency to overstate the case . It is not quite true , for example , that
REF 1529_6 has "
privatized " Mexicana de Aviacion , as Mr. Ortiz claims . In the same sentence
he contradicts himself when he reports that REF 1529_7 still
retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline . How can a company be
considered " privatized " if the state is so heavily represented in it ? ( True
, REF 1529_8 has
granted " control " over the airline to a new private consortium , but REF 1529_9
propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be
sanguine . ) Regrettably , too , Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar "
numbers game " when he boasts that " fewer than 392 { state enterprises }
currently remain in the public sector , " down from the 1,155 public entities
that existed in 1982 .
