subject: A comprehensive proposal (it/its)
helper sentence: This text is about a "comprehensive" proposal from the United States for
overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round
of multilateral trade negotiations.
text: The Bush administration said it is submitting REF 1135_1 . REF 1135_2 reiterates the U.S.
desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products
. But REF 1135_3 would allow
considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be
achieved . REF 1135_4
also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some
countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with
existing tariffs , then would be phased out over 10 years . Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled REF 1135_5 , said she is
confident REF 1135_6
will gain considerable support from the U.S. 's trading partners . Mr. Yeutter ,
seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that called for
eliminating all farm - trade barriers by the year 2000 , said REF 1135_7 would n't " put
farmers out of business " but would only encourage them to " grow what the
markets desire instead of what the government wants ." The U.S. is submitting REF 1135_8 today in Geneva ,
hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating
round concludes in December 1990 . Another U.S. proposal filed Monday urges more
" fair play " in services trade , including predictable and clear rules and
equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies
. Unlike the earlier U.S. farm - trade proposal which
struck European countries as too extreme , the latest plan would provide some
room for maneuver . For instance , the new U.S. package makes clear there would
be a transition period during which GATT members could use a combination of
tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition . It also
says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they
experience an unusually heavy volume of imports . Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm
subsidies , as the earlier U.S. proposal did , the new package calls for the
elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones . Less objectionable ones
would be subject only to some restraints , and others with a " relatively minor
trade impact " would be allowed to continue under certain conditions
. The new U.S. plan also would establish procedures to
prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade
arbitrarily . The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the
European Community 's current attempt to bar imports of beef from
hormone-treated U.S. cattle .
