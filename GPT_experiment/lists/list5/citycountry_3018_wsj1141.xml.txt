text: From the Sept. 30 - Oct . 4 issue of The Economist
: What defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the
Syrian army . The weight of Lebanon's history was also against him ; and it is a
history REF 1141_1 is in
danger of repeating . Like Lebanon , and however unfairly , REF 1141_2 is
regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration . REF 1141_3 best
hope of acceptance by REF 1141_4 neighbours lies in reaching a settlement
with the Palestinians . Like Lebanon , REF 1141_5 is being remade by demography . In Greater
Israel more than half the children under six are Muslims . Within 25 years Jews
will probably be the minority . Yet REF 1141_6 will neither share power with all these
Arabs nor , says REF 1141_7 present prime minister , redraw its
borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland . By not choosing one of these options , Israelis will
condemn themselves , as the Maronites did , to perpetual war with the Muslims in
their midst , and so to the internal erosion of their state .
