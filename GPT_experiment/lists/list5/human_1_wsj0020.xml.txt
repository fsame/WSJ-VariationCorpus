text: The U.S. , claiming some success in its trade diplomacy ,
removed South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is
closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents , copyrights and
other intellectual - property rights . However , five other countries -- China , Thailand ,
India , Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list
as a result of an interim review , REF 0020_1 announced . Under the new U.S. trade law , those
countries could face accelerated unfair - trade investigations and stiff trade
sanctions if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by
next spring . REF 0020_2 said many of the 25
countries that REF 0020_3 placed
under varying degrees of scrutiny have made " genuine progress " on this touchy
issue . REF 0020_4 said there is " growing
realization " around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms
all trading nations , and particularly the " creativity and inventiveness of an
{ offending } country 's own citizens . " U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with
inadequate protections for intellectual - property rights could be hurting
themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring
U.S. high-technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there
. REF 0020_5 lauded South Korea for
creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of
police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates . Seoul
also has instituted effective search-and-seizure procedures to aid these teams ,
REF 0020_6 said . Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by
initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending its trademark law and
introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized
showings of their films . That measure could compel Taipei 's growing number of
small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films
. Saudi Arabia , for its part , has vowed to enact a
copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to
computer software as well as to literary works , REF 0020_7 said . These three countries are n't completely off the hook ,
though . They will remain on a lower-priority list that includes 17 other
countries . Those countries -- including Japan , Italy , Canada , Greece and
Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less -
serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the "
priority " list . Gary Hoffman , a Washington lawyer specializing in
intellectual-property cases , said the threat of U.S. retaliation , combined
with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country
's own interest , prompted the improvements made by South Korea , Taiwan and
Saudi Arabia . " What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working , " he
said . He said Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the
priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law . REF 0020_8 said that the U.S. is
still concerned about " disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow
progress in Malaysia . " REF 0020_9 did n't
elaborate , although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette
piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey
. The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another
review of the performance of these countries by April 30 .
