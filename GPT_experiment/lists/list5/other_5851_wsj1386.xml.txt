text: Eastman Kodak Co. , seeking to position itself in the
potentially huge high-definition television market , unveiled REF 1386_1 . The move also helps the Rochester , N.Y. , photographic
giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a
virtual monopoly , supplying every Hollywood movie company -- is n't made
obsolete by the upstart HDTV business . While REF 1386_2 is costly , REF 1386_3 is being lauded by
the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows
that can be seen on the new medium . " The industry has been waiting with bated breath for
REF 1386_4 to come along , "
says David Niles , president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc. , a New York
pioneer in high-definition programming . He notes that industry executives have
until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once
consumers begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs . Japanese electronic giants , such as Sony Corp. and
Hitachi Ltd. , have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware , and virtually
ignored software or programs shot in high-definition . And only a handful of
small U.S. companies are engaged in high-definition software development . It 's
estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for
airing . Kodak says its REF 1386_5 will help alleviate the problem by allowing
programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in
35mm motion - picture film into high-definition video . Consumers will be able
to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high - tech
medium offers . Otherwise , they 'd be watching programs that are no different
in quality from what they currently view on color TVs . It would be like " watching a black and white movie on a
color TV set , " says Malcolm G. Saull , chairman of the film and video
department at the Rochester Institute of Technology . REF 1386_6 are " a critical
link between film and the television domain , " says Joerg D. Agin , vice
president and general manager of Kodak 's Motion Picture and Audiovisual
Products division . Kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when REF 1386_7 will be on the
market , but it 's estimated REF 1386_8 may be available within two years . A similar
machine already on the market , made by Rank Sintel Ltd. , a unit of Rank
Organisation , costs about $ 500,000 .
