text: At least 10 states are resisting REF 1296_1 nationwide effort to
settle REF 1296_2 legal troubles , and
some might instead try to revoke REF 1296_3 license to sell securities within their borders
. The reluctance of some states to let REF 1296_4 off the hook could
hamper REF 1296_5 attempts to polish
REF 1296_6 image after REF 1296_7 guilty plea to six
felonies last month , say several people familiar with the discussions
. Up to now , REF 1296_8 has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with
25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico . Just yesterday , New Hampshire
announced it made a $ 75,000 settlement with REF 1296_9 , a record-tying fine
for a securities - law matter in that state . These states have been entering
into settlements with REF 1296_10 as
part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its
record as an admitted felon . But individuals familiar with the generally successful
Drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including
New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri
.
