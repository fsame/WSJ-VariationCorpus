subject: New guidelines (they/them/their)
helper sentence: This article is about new guidelines from the Justice Department about
prosecutions under the federal racketeering law.
text: The Justice Department scrambled to play down the
significance of REF 1159_1
. REF 1159_2 were distributed to
U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press
reports this week . REF 1159_3
discourage prosecutors , under certain circumstances , from seeking court orders
seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial . But David Runkel
, chief Justice Department spokesman , said REF 1159_4 " are a codification
and a clarification far more than a new direction . " Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
law against white - collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime
figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars .
Critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before
a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the
forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into
unfavorable plea bargains . In REF 1159_5 ,
the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before
trial , " the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate
business activities of the defendant " and " will not seek ... to take from
third parties assets legitimately transferred to them . " REF 1159_6 also state , " The
government 's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the
law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime .
" Another provision clarifies certain limits on when
prosecutors may use tax - fraud charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering
case . Mr. Runkel declined to speculate on whether REF 1159_7 would curb
racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants . " The impact , if there
is any , will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether
to use { racketeering charges } is made in individual cases " by Justice
Department officials in Washington , he said . In a memorandum describing REF 1159_8 , Assistant Attorney
General Edward Dennis Jr. said that government efforts to freeze defendants '
assets pending racketeering prosecutions " have been the subject of considerable
criticism in the press . " But Mr. Runkel said the government is n't backing off
on these kinds of matters at all .
