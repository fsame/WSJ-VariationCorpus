text: When last we left him , REF 1397_1 had solved a murder
mystery , unraveled a Washington political scandal , and racked up some pretty
good ratings numbers in the miniseries `` Favorite Son . '' What next for REF 1397_2 ? A spinoff series ,
of course . There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and
most of them had already made the fall lineup : a nun raising some lovable
orphans . A den mother raising some lovable teen models . A bunch of tans and
bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards . In that context , Robert Loggia 's riveting performance
as REF 1397_3 seems a better
franchise for a series than most . Week by week on `` Mancuso FBI '' ( NBC ,
Fridays , 10 p.m . ET ) , REF 1397_4
pokes around the crime styles of the rich , famous and powerful of the
Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI . Over the first few weeks , `` Mancuso FBI '' has sprung
straight from the headlines , which is either a commendable stab at topicality ,
or a lack of imagination , or both . The opening show featured a secretary of
defense designate accused of womanizing ( a la John Tower ) . When his secretary
is found floating dead in the pol 's pool , REF 1397_5 is called in to
investigate . Last week , a young black girl claimed she had been raped
by a white police officer ( a la Tawana Brawley ) . In this week 's show , there
's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility ( a la Rocky Flats ) . Along the way , we 're introduced to the supporting cast
: a blond bombshell secretary ( Randi Brazen -- her real name , honest ) , a
scheming young boss ( Fredric Lehne ) , another blonde bombshell who 's also an
idealistic lawyer ( Lindsay Frost ) , and a forensics expert ( Charles Siebert )
. If all of this seems a little stale , it 's redeemed in
part by some tricky plot twists : The usual suspects are found to be guilty ,
then not guilty , then guilty -- but of a different crime . ( In last week 's
rape case , for example , the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest ,
and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case . ) Most of
all though , the show is redeemed by REF 1397_6 . What makes REF 1397_7 so endearing is REF 1397_8 hard - bitten
cynicism -- earned , we discover , when he was assigned to the civil rights
movement back in the 1960s . He was n't protecting the Freedom Marchers ; he was
tailing them as subversives .
