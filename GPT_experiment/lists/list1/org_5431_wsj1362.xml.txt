text: REF 1362_1 said a reserve REF 1362_2 is establishing to cover
expected pollution cleanup costs at an Ohio plant reduced REF 1362_3 third-quarter net income
by $ 1.9 million . REF 1362_4 declined to say if
REF 1362_5 would post a loss in the
third quarter . REF 1362_6
earned $ 774,000 in the quarter last year . REF 1362_7 is setting aside $ 3.1
million for the cleanup , but said the reserve reduced REF 1362_8 quarterly income by only
$ 1.9 million because of tax considerations . In addition , REF 1362_9 said REF 1362_10 signed a consent decree with Ohio to build a $
1.4 million pollution-control facility at the Ashtabula chemical manufacturing
plant by Aug. 1 , 1990 . Detrex said it is one of at least 17 companies notified
by the Environmental Protection Agency that they may be potentially responsible
for cleaning up the Fields Brook watershed near Detrex 's Ashtabula plant at a
total cost the EPA estimates at $48 million -- a figure Detrex said the
companies dispute.
