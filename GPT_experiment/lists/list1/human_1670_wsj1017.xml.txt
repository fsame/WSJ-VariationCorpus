text: The Democratic - controlled House , by a margin of 51
votes , failed to override REF 1017_1
veto of legislation renewing federal support of Medicaid abortions for poor
women who are victims of rape and incest . The 231 - 191 roll call illustrates the limits of power a
resurgent abortion - rights movement still faces . It continues to gain strength
in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to
prevail over REF 1017_2. Democrats voted to override by a 3 - 1 margin , but
Republicans were equally firm in support of REF 1017_3 . Yesterday 's vote dealt with the largest of these bills ,
an estimated $ 156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor ,
Education , and Health and Human Services . To gain more leverage ,
abortion-rights advocates may seek to fold the bill into an omnibus continuing
resolution next month . But the stark numbers yesterday -- when 282 votes were
needed -- indicate REF 1017_4
is in a commanding position for at least this year . " Unless REF 1017_5 changes , they lose
, " said a Democratic leadership aide . The action came as Congress sent to REF 1017_6 last night a stopgap
spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $
2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo
and the California earthquake. By a lopsided 97 - 1 margin , the Senate approved
the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential
California delegation and , despite reservations , the House adopted the bill on
a 303 - 107 roll call . The package is more than $ 1 billion above the
recommendations of Budget Director Richard Darman this week . But given the
political importance of California , the administration was content to use its
influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations.
The $ 2.85 billion measure comes on top of $ 1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo
struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month , and these totals do n't reflect
the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans . The bill last night includes $ 500 million to help
finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the Small
Business Administration sixfold to $ 1.8 billion to accommodate the expected
loan activity . In direct cash assistance , $ 1 billion is provided in federal
highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion is divided between general
emergency aid and a reserve to be available to REF 1017_7 to meet
unanticipated costs from the two disasters. In the Senate , Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his
position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment
than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next
six months.
