text: REF 1102_1 finished lower
yesterday , after tracking another rollercoaster session on Wall Street
. Concern about the volatile U.S. stock market had faded in
recent sessions , and traders appeared content to let REF 1102_2 languish in a narrow
range until tomorrow , when the preliminary report on third - quarter U.S. gross
national product is released . But seesaw gyrations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
yesterday put Wall Street back in the spotlight and inspired market participants
to bid REF 1102_3 lower . UAL 's decision to remain an independent company sent
share prices tumbling . By midmorning , the DJIA had plunged 80 points and
foreign - exchange dealers quickly drove REF 1102_4 down . When the DJIA modestly rebounded , REF 1102_5 bounced back in
choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late Monday . Stock prices
, meanwhile , posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only
3.69 points on the day . Some dealers said that the market 's strong reaction to
Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about REF 1102_6 . They added that
the DJIA 's swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market to drive REF 1102_7 in the direction
REF 1102_8 was already headed
. In late New York trading yesterday , REF 1102_9 was quoted at 1.8355
marks , down from 1.8470 marks Monday , and at 141.45 yen , down from 141.90 yen
late Monday . Sterling was quoted at $ 1.6055 , up from $ 1.6030 late Monday
. In Tokyo Wednesday , REF 1102_10 opened for trading
at 141.57 yen , down from Tuesday 's Tokyo close of 142.10 yen . Tom Trettien , a vice president with Banque Paribas in
New York , sees a break in the dollar 's long - term upward trend , a trend that
began in January 1988 .
