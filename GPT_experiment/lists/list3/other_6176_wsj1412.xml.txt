text: How interestingly clever of Robert Goldberg to use the
form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of REF 1412_1 in his television
critique ( Leisure & Arts , Sept 11 ) . He chastises Jo Franklin - Trout for
her inept presentation of advocacy journalism , judging REF 1412_2 as " intellectually
slipshod . " Was not the title very clear ? One example he gives : " She did n't
ask " ( why the Palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones ) . Really now
, did she have to ask ? Were not the pictures and happenings , which have been
continuing news headlines , answers enough ? Mr. Goldberg contends that even as " propaganda " REF 1412_3 fails because REF 1412_4 presents only one
view . Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment ; of course the
Israelis feel put upon . But his complaint that REF 1412_5 does n't contain
balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving is
irrelevant . It 's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that
equal time be given to how terrific white South Africans are . REF 1412_6 did emphasize how
long the Israeli / Palestinian stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to
the days of World War I when the British tried to guarantee both a Jewish state
and a Palestinian state without specifying how it was to be . Well , " Days of Rage " airing with before - and - after
packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning . Every issue is
multisided . REF 1412_7
attempts to show a side rarely seen in our media . Now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish
to know details of one side only .
