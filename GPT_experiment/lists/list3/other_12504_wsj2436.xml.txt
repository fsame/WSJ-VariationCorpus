text: Roger Rosenblatt , editor of REF 2436_1 , resigned Friday
from REF 2436_2 . Mr. Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties
with commuting between his home in New York and REF 2436_3 editorial offices
in Washington . " Frankly , I missed my family , " said Mr. Rosenblatt
. In Mr. Rosenblatt 's tenure , REF 2436_4 advertising pages
and circulation have grown significantly . But at 2.3 million weekly paid
circulation , REF 2436_5
still ranks third behind Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , with 4.4 million
circulation , and Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek , with 3.3 million circulation
. Mortimer B. Zuckerman , chairman and editor in chief ,
said Mr. Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby , REF 2436_6 executive editor ,
and Merrill McLoughlin , a senior writer . Mr. Ruby and Ms. McLoughlin are
married to each other . Mr. Zuckerman said REF 2436_7 would maintain
REF 2436_8 editorial format ,
which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service-oriented , how-to
articles . Mr. Rosenblatt , a senior writer at Time magazine before
joining REF 2436_9 , said he had
numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor . The offers were
to work as a writer , not an editor .
