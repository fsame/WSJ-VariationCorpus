text: Ingersoll Publications Co. agreed to buy the New Haven
Register in a transaction valued at $ 275 million from REF 1316_1 . As part of the agreement , REF 1316_2 also terminated the
contract under which Ingersoll manages REF 1316_3 66 newspapers , ending a long association between
the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently . REF 1316_4 has accused Ingersoll of
paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent
launch of the St. Louis Sun . Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about
$ 255 million for the Register , a daily that REF 1316_5 bought for about $ 170
million in 1986 . REF 1316_6 will
pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the management contract .
REF 1316_7 also announced that
REF 1316_8 hired the former
president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers .
Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr
